    abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

    abstract = {The increase in life expectancy is undoubtedly a social achievement. If we want an inclusive and integrating society, the inclusion of the age perspective is key when planning the city and its services. Accordingly, this is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in SDG 11.2, which aims to provide and expand access to public transport with special attention to the needs of the elderly. In general, the data required to evaluate public transportation is managed by the bus operators and/or other entities that decide whether (or not) to share it. This hardnesses the independent evaluation of the bus service by third-party stakeholders. Thus, this article aims to objectively assess the bus network’s quality of service, relying exclusively on available socio-demographic and mobility open data, highlighting the elderly as target users in the city of Melilla (Spain). The open data available allowed the computation of indicators, such as journey times estimation or bus stop distribution to evaluate the universality in access to public transport. However, it has been noted that the lack of available data prevents the calculation of other age-friendly indicators. The main result of this research is that bus service provides a considerable reduction in journey times for the elderly than for non-elderly},

An understanding of service reliability is necessary to develop strategies that help transit agencies provide better services. However, few studies have been conducted analyzing bus reliability in the metropolis of China. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of service reliability based on bus operational characteristics in Beijing. Three performance parameters, punctuality index based on routes (PIR), deviation index based on stops (DIS), and evenness index based on stops (EIS), are proposed for the evaluation of bus service reliability. Reliability involves routes, stops, punctuality, deviation, and evenness. The relationship among the three parameters is discussed using a numerical example. Subsequently, through a sampling survey of bus lines in Beijing, service reliability at the stop, route, and network levels are estimated. The effects of route length, headway, the distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the use of exclusive bus lanes are also analyzed. The results indicate low service reliability for buses in Beijing and a high correlation between service reliability and route length, headway, distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the provision of exclusive bus lanes.},

    abstract = {Knowing the mobility patterns of citizens using public transportation is an important issue for modern smart cities. Mobility information is crucial for designing and planning an urban transportation system able to provide good service to citizens. We address two relevant problems related to public transportation systems: the analysis of mobility patterns of passengers and the relocation of bus stops in an urban area. For the first problem, a big-data approach is applied to process large volume one space of information. Several relevant metrics are computed and analyzed to characterize the mobility patterns using data from the public transportation system on Montevideo, Uruguay. We obtain user demand and origin-destination matrices by analyzing the tickets sale information and the buses locations. A distributed implementation is proposed, reaching significant execution time improvements (speedup up to 17.10 when using 24 computing resources). For the second problem, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to relocate bus stops in order to improve the quality of service by minimizing the travel time and bus operational costs. The algorithm is evaluated over instances of the problem generated with real data from the year 2015. The experimental results show that the algorithm is able to obtain improvements of up to 16.7 and 33.9% in time and cost respectively, compared to space situation in the year 2015.},

We leverage on travel histories collected from automated fare collection system (AFC) to extract features of personal transport usage and study their predictive power to forecast whether people access public transport services on a future day or not.},

    abstract = {The implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a part of smart mobility is crucial for solving the current problems of the transportation industry. The setting up and maintenance of ITS requires not only the current passenger demand but also the future passenger demand. The future passenger demand can be obtained with time-series forecasting carried out with different techniques. With the advancements in the technological field, modern and more advanced methods of time-series forecasting using deep learning are being preferred over traditional forecasting techniques. However, the research carried out in this regard is quite limited, particularly considering the Indian scenario. Hence this research work focuses on exploring the performance of deep learning forecasting techniques considering the aspects mentioned previously. Here, the forecasting of passenger demand was done with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using the three months Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) data of the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HDBRTS) as part of a case study. Then the forecasting of passenger demand was also done with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the comparison of the forecasting accuracy of both methods was made using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Furthermore, to validate the results, novel approach has been adopted for the process, by following some more time-series resampled with different time intervals. Study shows that LSTMs will be used satisfactorily in the traffic conditions of developing counties, for forecasting passenger demand using APC data. Study also provides detailed guiding methodologies of advanced methods of passenger forecasting along with conventional ones.},

We then analyse the performance of these models by using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as the performance metric. In order to improve the model performance, we employ a multi-level clustering technique where we aggregate demand over neighboring cells/geohashes. We observe that the improved model based on clustering leads to a forecast accuracy of 80% per km 2 . In addition, our technique obtains an accuracy of 89% per km 2 for the most frequently occurring use case.},

This is particularly necessary in view of the complex city structure and transportation system in Hong Kong.

To assist commuters in making better use of public transport, the system needs to be not only user friendly and informative but intelligent enough to provide optimal route choices in terms of users' travelling behavior or preference as well. The web-map public transport enquiry system, as described in this paper, gives a good example of providing bilingual (English and Chinese) information on all public transports run in Hong Kong in the form of interactive maps and texts, as well as real-time derivation of optimal travelling routes for users in terms of multiple criteria, i.e., preferred mode, least changes, shortest travelling time, or lowest fare},

    abstract = {Real-time transit information offers many benefits to transit riders, including reduced wait times and increased customer satisfaction. However, offering real-time transit services has been challenging for many transit agencies. While mobile applications (apps) have emerged as a preferred dissemination method for real-time information, it is typically cost-prohibitive for transit agencies to fund custom development of native mobile apps for all popular smartphone platforms. Third-party developers can offer services if an agency openly shares real-time data, but these individuals are volunteers whose priorities and deadlines may not be the same as the agency’s. As a result, few cities have full app portfolios that cover all smartphone platforms. This paper presents the OneBusAway multi-region project, a collaborative effort that is enabling the rapid expansion of native mobile transit apps to new cities. OneBusAway is an open-source transit information system that has provided real-time transit services to the Puget Sound (Washington) area since 2008. The new OneBusAway multi-region feature expands the coverage of the existing Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, and Windows 8 apps for OneBusAway to new cities, including Tampa and Atlanta. The multi-region system architecture, collaborative design and development process, and lessons learned from this ground-breaking project are discussed. The fundamental shift from proprietary to open-source software in the transit industry that has made this type of project possible also is examined.},

The lack of this amenity in rural areas, however, may hamper public transport use, thus reinforcing patterns of over-reliance on personal vehicles. To explore the potential impacts of providing RTPI in rural areas, a smartphone application (GetThereBus) was developed to allow rural bus passengers to share real-time public transport data, and access real-time and timetable information. Through user testing of GetThereBus, this work aimed to address questions related to the impact of the limited availability of rural digital infrastructure on the provision of RTPI; the potential for crowdsourced information to supplement published timetable information given digital limitations; and the potential impacts of such a system on the traveller experience. This study describes the GetThereBus development and evaluation phases. The authors found it was possible to design and develop a system that overcame many of the technological limitations experienced in rural areas, and users reported a positive response to the system. However, despite a campaign of user engagement, it proved difficult to recruit and motivate sufficient users to provide the data needed to achieve area-wide coverage.},
