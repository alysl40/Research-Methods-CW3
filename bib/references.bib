  abstract = {Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

  abstract = {The increase in life expectancy is undoubtedly a social achievement. If we want an inclusive and integrating society, the inclusion of the age perspective is key when planning the city and its services. Accordingly, this is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in SDG 11.2, which aims to provide and expand access to public transport with special attention to the needs of the elderly. In general, the data required to evaluate public transportation is managed by the bus operators and/or other entities that decide whether (or not) to share it. This hardnesses the independent evaluation of the bus service by third-party stakeholders. Thus, this article aims to objectively assess the bus network’s quality of service, relying exclusively on available socio-demographic and mobility open data, highlighting the elderly as target users in the city of Melilla (Spain). The open data available allowed the computation of indicators, such as journey times estimation or bus stop distribution to evaluate the universality in access to public transport. However, it has been noted that the lack of available data prevents the calculation of other age-friendly indicators. The main result of this research is that bus service provides a considerable reduction in journey times for the elderly than for non-elderly},

  abstract = {Improving the reliability of bus service has the potential to increase the attractiveness of public transit to current and prospective riders. An understanding of service reliability is necessary to develop strategies that help transit agencies provide better services. However, few studies have been conducted analyzing bus reliability in the metropolis of China. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of service reliability based on bus operational characteristics in Beijing. Three performance parameters, punctuality index based on routes (PIR), deviation index based on stops (DIS), and evenness index based on stops (EIS), are proposed for the evaluation of bus service reliability. Reliability involves routes, stops, punctuality, deviation, and evenness. The relationship among the three parameters is discussed using a numerical example. Subsequently, through a sampling survey of bus lines in Beijing, service reliability at the stop, route, and network levels are estimated. The effects of route length, headway, the distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the use of exclusive bus lanes are also analyzed. The results indicate low service reliability for buses in Beijing and a high correlation between service reliability and route length, headway, distance from the stop to the origin terminal, and the provision of exclusive bus lanes.},
